Mary Gabrielle Heffron (1892-1941) was the only child of John Heffron (1847-1933) and Anna Haley (1855-1929).
John Heffron co-owned a shirt factory in Glens Falls, and Gabrielle Heffron attended Glens Falls Academy and then continued on at Mount Saint Vincent's Academy (now College) in New York City. Dad's autobiography mentions that his maternal grandfather John Heffron's home was nearby, at the corner of Glen and Birch St.

On June 25, 1913, Gabrielle Heffron married Hugh S Lavery (1996-1935), an attorney (Cornell Law 1910) whose practice seems to have been "Family Law" (separations, divorces, and the like)

The Lavery family lived with Hugh S. Lavery's father, Samuel Lavery (1850-1928), in his house on
upper Glen Street, Queensbury NY.  My father's autobiography mentions a "high curb" in the area, and there are still several large houses there beyond such a  curb, but I am not sure which is which. Samuel was the widower of Bridget Falvey (1856-1911).  She was not alive at the time of my father's birth.

Samuel Lavery had inherited a large farm from his paternal uncle, Hugh Lavery (1811-1884), who was married but died without heirs, by way of his (Samuel's) father John's estate (1820-1885). "Uncle" Hugh and his brother John were from Magheralin, County Down, Ireland and fled the infamous potato famine, together with their mother, in 1836-1837. Their father, John, had died in the Great Hunger.  "Uncle" Hugh had a skilled trade (as a wagon and carriage maker) and invested his spare cash in land and buildings.

Samuel seems to have lived rather well by selling off the land over time....a large fraction of Crandall Park in Glens Falls was once Lavery land.
Samuel was also remarkably litigious, even at one point filing a suit against his own mother over posession of various carriages and sleighs.  I suspect that Hugh S Lavery's legal practice was pre-ordained, as it were.

My father said that the Lavery family lived very comfortable lives in the 1920s, throwing fancy parties and exchanging expensive gifts with friends and clients. This sterling silver powder compact, although worse for wear *(it should have a tassel of fine silver chain on top)*, shows that they had luxuries to enjoy.

However, Hugh S Lavery died suddenly in 1935 (he was only 49 years old). My father, who had been a "clerk" in his father's law office (a job he did not enjoy at all) suddenly had to work very hard to support his mother and brothers.   

He was hired on state conservation job at first, cutting spruce budworm out of leaders on a tree farm. In 1937 he and his brother John Lavery (1917-1994) found jobs in the International Paper facility then in Fort Edward, NY.

At the Fort Edward mill, Dad met Foster Doane (MIT 1920) who encouraged my dad to enroll at MIT. He started there in 1940 (Dad was 26 and many years out of school...it had to be a shock). He graduated in 1947 after a stint in the Army from April 1943 until he was dischared in 1946.  

These letters cover Dad's first year at MIT, from October 1940 up to his mother, Gabrielle's, sudden death on 6 April 1941.  She was only 49 years old.
