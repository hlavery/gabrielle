| ![](img206.jpg?height=700px) | Just a note to say I lived through the draft *(Gabrielle was on the local board...ed)*.  It was bad on my eyes. You had to print the card and I do not shine at that.  John spelled me at night. Thomas LaHaise was married yesterday.  He looked very happy at the polls. I did not see them married. Phil is doing the early break |
| ![](img207.jpg?height=700px) | this week.  He likes it the best of all also He is Aunt Jules *(Julia Haley McCann, Gabrielle's maternal aunt ... ed)* right hand man.  Aunty is pretty well and glad to hear from you. Mr. D *(Foster Doane..ed.)* told John *(brother...ed)* he had a letter from you so I guess everything is all right. I hope you like your new room also your roommate.  It is more pleasant having someone with you. |
| ![](img208.jpg?height=700px) | John and Phil *(Dad's brothers...ed)*  are quite the pals never did I expect to see the day, some things I have to laugh at. Well dear will say good-by be a good boy and God bless you.  MOTHER  GABRIELLE LAVERY
