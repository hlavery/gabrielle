| ![](img265.jpg?height=700px) |Dear Hugh<p> Everything is fine here.  We are all well believe it or not I was down to see "Gone With the Wind" yesterday.   It is all and more than they say about it.  Phil is tournament(ing?). Here is the payoff Phil wanted his pants pressed so John pressed them and made Phil give him a quarter.</p><p>They are having class tomorrow at the mill.  Phil is supposed to go but he says he will not.  He has had all the school he is going to.  They are trying to make him a runner, he is supposed to stay after work for an hour but he did not stay yesterday.</p><p>If you write to the Draft board address it to (Mr. Robert Carter,[^1], Draft board, City Hall).</p><p> Sorry you will not be home for Easter but it will not be long now.  John received a card from Bobby Mc. He is stationed in Texas so is Charles McGuffin.</p><p>Keep up the good work and Pray and God will bless you.  Hope you received your laundry.</p><p>Mother</p><p>P.S. Putting 70 bucks in bank this morning. |

[^1]:  Mr Carter, mentioned several time in the letters, is thus the Chairman of the local Draft Board, who decides on deferments
