| ![](img266.jpg?height=600px) |Dear Hugh<p>I think your concern over the families health is unwarranted. Mother had a bit of an intestinal grip and an ugly looking nose that is improving but nothing more serious. Mother's health during this winter has been much better than during any of the last five winters.</p><p> Work has been good the company has kept running five days a week starting up on Mondays. This policy has been very wise for the company and very good for the employees. No. 1 Machine has been converted into a tissue paper machine. This is a 100% Bleached Sulfite[^1] sheet with the pulp beaten to a freeness of 150.[^2] The beating time sometimes takes as long as nine hours as the Jordans[^3] that would cut the fibers are not used. The sheet runs 10 to 15 pounds[^4] and is a wrapping tisssue which will sell for 8 cents a pound.  This change is still in the experiment stage with a good order behind it.  All the big shots help making this sheet, a week has passed and none.... |
