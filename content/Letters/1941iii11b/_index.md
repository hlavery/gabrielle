<p>  Although anti-climactic, this letter from John to Hugh on March 11 shows just how unexpected Gabrielle's death was </p>

| ![](img266.jpg?height=700px) |Dear Hugh<p>**I think your concern over the families health is unwarranted. Mother had a bit of an intestinal grip and an ugly looking nose that is improving but nothing more serious. Mother's health during this winter has been much better than during any of the last five winters.</p>**<p> Work has been good the company has kept running five days a week starting up on Mondays. This policy has been very wise for the company and very good for the employees. No. 1 Machine has been converted into a tissue paper machine. This is a 100% Bleached Sulfite[^1] sheet with the pulp beaten to a freeness of 150.[^2] The beating time sometimes takes as long as nine hours as the Jordans[^3] that would cut the fibers are not used. The sheet runs 10 to 15 pounds[^4] and is a wrapping tisssue which will sell for 8 cents a pound.  This change is still in the experiment stage with a good order behind it.  All the big shots help making this sheet, a week has passed and none.... |
| ![](img267.jpg?height=700px) |...of the paper has yet been sold.[^5] They have had plenty of trouble but have gotten the sheet over several times and had a good sheet.  As result have had several good orders with paper colored at the size press.[^6] By this process you get a good color on one or both sides of the sheet at a fraction of the cost.  We have made color samples by mixing the color in 2 1/2 Be'[^7] starch and Larry[^8] and myself would apply solution at each side of the size press, rip off the slab of paper from the winder and cut samples from the slab. The other day we tried 12 new types of colors. The color was mixed with 1 part of alcohol and two parts of water instead of the starch.  The paper on the machine was changed from a heliotrope to a green and the new paper was just regulated O.K. Before they went on the green we were to apply our 12 color samples.  Larry[^8] decided we would first apply 100% alcohol first to clear any remains of the heliotrope. The sheet was 110# Alace.  When on my side I applied the alcohol the sheet immediately broke, I quit pouring, and immediately looked to see how Larry was making out.  He had a fire started which caused some alarm and somebody turned the hose on Larry.  After filling one brokecart [^9] they...|
| ![](img268.jpg?height=700px) |...again regulated the sheet and we then proceeded to apply the colors. We poured together and the sheet immediately broke again.  Larry then consulted Foster[^10] and we then turned the water on the underside of the sheet and successfully applied the colors. The results of this were poor for the alcohol drew traces of the color through this sheet.</p><p>**How the draft will affect you next year worries me.** Bob McCarthy and Chas. McGuffin were in the last group from home.<p/><p>**Mother thinks your writing to Mr. Carter[^11] would be better than my going to see him.**</p><p>**The financial picture for next year looks bright.  The end of this month makes 6 months that you have been away and we will have put away about $300.  This is at a rate of $600 for the year and if this falls short we still will gather a sum.  There is also $100 you have not taken and you might earn money this summer.  The smallest scholarship or a non-interest loan from Finn[^12] ought to make borrowing from the school unnecessary and foolish.**</p><p>We have not had a report on your school work since mid-year.  Why?<p/><p/>Your federal income tax cost me $1.91 + 0.10 for a check.  The collector advised me not to let you claim $200 for Phil.  I revised your report and forged your name in front of a Deputy collector who certified your signature<p/><p>John    | 

[^1]: Bleached Sulfite: Softwood chips were cooked in a sulfurous acid + Calcium bisulfite  solution (made by burning sulfur and ducting the Sulfur dioxide gas up a tower packed with Calcium carbonate rock against a counter-flow of water.  The cooking liquor was drawn off the bottom of the tower and then used to digest the wood chips in a pressure vessel at ca. 300F and extreme acidity (pH~1). The fully-cooked pulp chips, with far less lignin content gluing the cellulose fibers together, were then easily worked apart into individual fibers.  The pulp was easily bleached.  The fatal flaw in the process was the vast amount of water pollution; downstream of a sulfite mill was a nightmare of "sewage fungus" *(sphaerotilus natans).* A further problem was that Southern pine species could not be effectively processed, due to their high resin content.  The Calcium-based sulfite process is now rare, and when used the spent pulp liquor itself is usually the more valuable product (it can be processed into Vanillin (imitation vanilla) and other synthetic flavors and provides an excellent lignosulfonate dispersant. Modern versions of Sulfite pulping  with some form of chemical recovery are available. The alkaine Kraft process is far more common.
[^2]: Freeness is a standard measurement of how readily water drains from a pulp suspension, the lower the number the slower the drainage.
[^3]: Jordan is the name of a kind of pulp beater invented ca. 1860.  The process Uncle John describes here probably involved a "Hollander" beater, developed ca. 1680.  The Hollander beater involves an oval trough in which pulp is moved along by a rotating drum with raised slats.  The drum operated against a base plate, again with slats, which was leveraged into position by weights.  Both processes fibrillated the pulp fibers by mechanically weakining the fiber structure, eventually allowing the interlocked web of paper to be formed.  The Jordan involved a cone-in-cone construction, which worked more quickly but was more likely to reduce average fiber length.  The modern disk refiner in its present form was not invented until the 1950s.
[^4]: Basis Weight: weight per area of paper, now mostly expressed in grams per square meter (gsm). Traditional Bases were often odd, coated freesheet was usually sold as pounds per 3300 square feet and some container board grades as pounds per 1000 square feet.  I do not know what the basis of wrapping paper tissue was back in the day.
[^5]: This delay is the usual effect of the "help" of "big shots" in the paper industry (as elsewhere)
[^6]: Size Press: After the paper was formed, pressed, and partially dried, the pair of mated rolls called a size press allowed the application of materials to the paper surface to improve printability or, in the case Uncle John describes here, adjust the color of the paper.  The sized and/or colored paper then passes through further drying sections to the winder. There were better methods of providing size press agents other than having a couple of guys with buckets at either side of the papermachine.  This was clearly an experimental expedient.
[^7]: Baume':  The Baume' hydrometer indicates the specific gravity of a suspension, here of corn starch gelatinized in water.  2.5  Be' is around 4.4% starch by weight.
[^8]: Larry is Lawrence Tobias, evidently John's supervisor in these experiments.
[^9]: Brokecart:  When the sheet failed on machine, the jumble of loose paper had to be put somewhere while awaiting its trip back to the broke pulpers hence the brokecart.
[^10]: Foster (Doane) is the Fort Edward mill general superindendant at this time.
[^11]:Mr. Carter is the head of the local draft board, and influences deferments.
[^12]: Finn is the family attorney at this point, and will be doing Aunt Jule's estate when the time comes. He could have well afforded a loan on favorable terms, being aware of Aunt Jule's will and assets. I believe Dad got a scholarship and, eventually, GI bill support.
