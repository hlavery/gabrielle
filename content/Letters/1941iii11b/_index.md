<p>  Although anti-climactic, this letter from John to Hugh on March 11 shows just how unexpected Gabrielle's death was </p>

| ![](img266.jpg?height=600px) |Dear Hugh<p>I think your concern over the families health is unwarranted. Mother had a bit of an intestinal grip and an ugly looking nose that is improving but nothing more serious. Mother's health during this winter has been much better than during any of the last five winters.</p><p> Work has been good the company has kept running five days a week starting up on Mondays. This policy has been very wise for the company and very good for the employees. No. 1 Machine has been converted into a tissue paper machine. This is a 100% Bleached Sulfite[^1] sheet with the pulp beaten to a freeness of 150.[^2] The beating time sometimes takes as long as nine hours as the Jordans[^3] that would cut the fibers are not used. The sheet runs 10 to 15 pounds[^4] and is a wrapping tisssue which will sell for 8 cents a pound.  This change is still in the experiment stage with a good order behind it.  All the big shots help making this sheet, a week has passed and none.... |

As result have had several good orders with paper colored at the size press.[^6] By this process you get a good color on one or both sides of the sheet at a fraction of the cost.  We have made color samples by mixing the color in 2 1/2 Be[^7] starch and Larry[^8] and myself would apply solution at each side of the size press, rip off the slab of paper from the winder and cut samples from the slab. The other day we tried 12 new types of colors. The color was mixed with 1 part of alcohol and two parts of water instead of the starch.  The paper on the machine was changed from a heliotrope to a green and the new paper was just regulated O.K. |

[^1]: Bleached Sulfite: Softwood chips were cooked in a sulfurous acid solution (made by burning sulfur and ducting the gases up a tower packed with Calcium carbonate rock against a counter-flow of water.  The cooking liquor was drawn off the bottom of the tower and then used to digest the chips.   The cooked pulp chips, with a greatly reduced lignin content to hold the ceellulose fibers together, were  the easily worked apart into individual fibers.  The pulp was easily bleached.  The fatal flaw in the process was the vast amount of water pollution; downstream of a sulfite mill was a nightmare of "sewage fungus" *(sphaerotilus natans).* A further problem was that Southern pine species could not be effectively processed, due to their high resin content.  The sulfite process is now very rare, and when used the spent pulp liquor is usually the more valuable product (it can be processed into Vanillin (imitation vanilla) and other synthetic flavors.
[^2]: Freeness
[^3]: Jordan
[^4]: Basis Weight: weight per area of paper, now mostly expressed in grams per square meter (gsm). Traditional Bases were often odd, coated freesheet was usually sold as pounds per 3300 square feet and some container board grades as pounds per 1000 square feet.  I do not know what the basis of wrapping paper tissue was back in the day.
[^5]: This delay is the usual effect of the "help" of "big shots" in the paper industry (as elsewhere)
[^6]: Size Press
[^7]: Baume':  The Baume' hydrometer indicates the specific gravity of a suspension, here of corn starch in water.  2.5  Be' is around 4.4% starch by weight.
[^8]: Larry is Lawrence Tobias, evidently John's supervisor in these experiments.
