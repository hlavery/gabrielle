| ![](img227.jpg?height=700px) | Dear Hugh;  Sorry your laundry was delayed so long.  I had a bad cold in fact sick in bed.  Hugh you asked how everything was going as good as could be expected with two and three days' work. John is a whiz with the money but no luxuries.  Phil is good too. |
| ![](img225.jpg?height=700px) | I wish they could both get other jobs every place in the U.S.A. is running full blast but down there(?) I think John could get a job at the G.E. if he tries.  Phil is trying all the time for another job.  I miss you terrible will be glad when Xmas comes.  It is Thanksgiving time so true to form I am melancholy.  Can not really be over the cold. | 
| ![](img226.jpg?height=700px) | Aunt Jule is very well and ~~sarcastic~~ caustic.  John is doing an extra from 4 to 12 tonight. Larry Tobias[^1] lives over on Notre Dame St. in fact brought his wife here from the city and John is his right hand man.  Hope you have a happy Thanksgiving go out and have a good time.  Love Mother | 

[^1]: Lawrence Sawyer Tobias (1917-1965) and his wife Rita (1915-1975) also worked in the International Paper Company mill, then in Fort Edward, NY.  Mr Tobias had perhaps just started work, as the 1940 census lists him as a college-graduate "paper apprentice" at $1170/yr.  John Lavery must have assisted him at IP in some capacity.
