| ![](img223.jpg?height=700px) | Dear Hugh;<p> Glad to receive your two letters and know you received your laundry.  What kind of starch did they use in those shirts?</p><p>  I have had a bad cold so I just sent up for a bottle of that cough medicine you had.  No wonder it cures it is full of Codeine and Turpentine.  It cures but nearly kills.</p><p>  Phil is doing a twelve hour tour this week.  He seems to enjoy his work instead of being tired.  Also joined the *(union?...ed)* last week and does not think the fellows are so bad when dressed up.</p><p> Your friend *(illegible...ed)* drew the first ballot *(for the military draft ...ed)* in this section.  What is your number? That is a dreadful thing to think about.</p><p> |
| ![](img224.jpg?height=700px) | </p><p>By the way, you have nice *("nice"[^1] ...ed)* friends.  Aunt Jule has some stock called in so she told John to send Hodges up to her.  Mr Hodges is reposing in jail over in Fonda.</p><p>  Also am glad that you are doing better in your subjects.  Do you go to Church? Never hear you speak of it.  Your landlady is very kind.  How much do you weigh now?  John plods along just the same.  He is a pretty grand boy.  Phil has them robbed at the mill winning their money on football games.  In fact, he is ~~flying~~ going high.</p><p>   Can not do laundry until after Tuesday as I sit on polls from 5:30 to 9 that day. What does Cambridge feel about it *(i.e., the 1940 Presidential Election...ed)*?</p><p>  Be a good boy and best of luck.</p><p>  Love Mother</p><p>  p.s. Hope you can read this pen is awful |
