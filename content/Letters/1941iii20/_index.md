| ![](img261.jpg?height=800px) |Dear Hugh;<p>Two days ago I wrote you but as the letter was not mailed I just tore it up.  This week I lost my errand boy as he is sleeping days.  We have had such cold weather and high winds I could not get out, but am going down to bank this afternoon for Aunty.  I feel quite rich cutting coupons[^1]. She had to give me power of attorney to get in her box.</p><p>Very pleased over your scholarship and do not worry over marks I think they are good.  Remember you were seven years out of school.  About that loan how much can you borrow? The full six hundred dollars?</p><p>If they do not work Saturday John is going down to see Mr. Carter[^2] but I still think you yourself should write him.  Billy Nolan left this morning.  Darling we trust to the will of God you can be deferred at least for another year.</p><p> |
| ![](img262.jpg?height=800px) |When Phil came in this morning he said he hoped Larry[^3] had a sense of humor.  In taking the leakage he got tired of writing "slight" so he marks "not bad".  Last Saturday he played ball with the Y in Albany, came home saw the Lions play at the K[^4] Then went to see "Tobacco Road" at midnight[^5] ended up at Johnnys.  Now the argument is over the tournament but Phil deserves to go he has been very good and would hate to see him stay in the way John does.</p><p>Am much better so send laundry home.  Aunty is well in fact fine talking about a permanent oh her vanity.</p><p>How is Mrs Gibbons also the roommate.  By the way you should drop Mary Finn[^6] a card for her engagement. </p><p>Keep well and good <br/>Mother |

[^1]: "Coupons"...it was common back then to keep stocks and bonds in certificate form locked in a bank box.  The periodic dividends had to be redeemed by sending in coupons which had to be clipped from the certificates.  Although cumbersome, this process avoided the very real possiblity of broker theft and/or the "loaning out" of one's holdings for short sales.
[^2]:  "Mr. Carter" is Chair of the local draft board, and so has a say in Dad's student deferment.
[^3]: "Larry" Tobias was mentioned in an earlier letter as Phil's supervisor at the papermill.
[^4]: "The K" or Knights of Columbus Auditorium, used also for basketball games, as here. The Glens Falls Lions was one of the teams.
[^5]: "Tobacco Road." the movie, in a midnight showing at the Rialto theater.
[^6]: "Mary Finn" a recently-engaged young neighbor of Aunt Jule on Grove Street..
