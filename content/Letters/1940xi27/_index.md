They sent for Phil down at the post-office to work Xmas week so he flew up and ask(ed) Doanes *(i.e., Foster Doane, his boss at the papermill...ed)* if he could have the time off.  Doanes said by all means to take it as thirty-five dollars was thirty-five dollars but here is the catch he *(the boss...ed)* would arrange his *(Phil's...ed)* time for night so if your home *(i.e. if Phil is home from the post office gig early enough...ed)*... |

I am wondering if he *(i.e. Doane...ed)* heard what Phil said about him down there.   Phil said they were closer than brothers. *(maybe so, but Mr. Doane took care of my Dad and John first...ed)* Your letter just arrived I am sorry you can not accept Mrs. Doanes' invitation but have a good dinner anyways.  Tomorrow we... |

I do not think she is very well but as is usual says nothing.  She got the man at the bank to do her business.  Your marks are O.K. say a prayer for the old Calculus(?)  |

"Charlotte Heights", probably Phil's joke name for the half-duplex at 10 1/2 Charlotte Street where the Laverys lived at the time, as it appears in 2021.
