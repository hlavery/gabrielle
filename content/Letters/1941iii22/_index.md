| ![](img263.jpg?height=700px) |Dear Hugh;<p>Just a line to tell you your brothers are working six days this week.  So John cannot go down to see Mr. Carter[^1].  Why do you not drop him a line.  In the letter explain how you can get a scholarship and what it means.  I do not know if anything can be done or not. </p><p>Aunty had another sad calamity, her heater stopped the other night when the man came next day it was so dirty he said he wondered it had gone at all</p><p>Are you coming home for Easter you are more than welcome if you can come.  I will be glad when the tournament[^2] is over what an argument is going on.  Hugh write Phil a letter he says he is just a cog in the Lavery machine and really he is very good.  Remember, he has not the same temperament as you and John.</p><p>Love, Mother |

[^1]: Mr Carter is the Chair of the local draft board, so the issue appears to be with continuing Dad's defermemt
[^2]: The basketball tournament in which Phil wished to participate apparently had some fees, which were an object of dissention.
