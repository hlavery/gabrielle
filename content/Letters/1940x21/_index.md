| ![](img221.jpg?height=700px) | Your letter just arrived to John as he is at the mill (worrying over frozen weir?) I opened it.  We made the mistake of our lives not to let John handle the money before.  He is a born bargain hunter. Here is a laugh and the first John and I have fallen out.  Our neighbors [^1] have smoked us out.   So last night when it started I was going to send for fire company.  Was John mad if I had been alone I would have done it.  The Shermans (*not identified...ed)* came in - they said it was not wood odor.  Oh it was awful.  I think she does it on purpose.  I called Middleton *(the landlord?...ed)* and said if it dod not stop we would move (Where?)  Jim Loughlin was over the other night... |

Oh boy that was some session with Aunty, but she is going to do it.  Phil worked twelve hours the other day and instead of coming home went up to the Y and played basketball so I guess he is strong enough.  They came and took the boys out of the Mill to the Army.  When time came I guess they were sorry they signed up.  John says Phil should get a couple of twelve hours this week breaking in the new boy that will be with him.  I think it is Nolan's brother *(poss. the Nolan in an earlier letter who skipped work for 3 hours to go the vaudeville show...ed)* Send laundry anytime.  What about your registration? Be sure and see that it is sent as a lot of trouble will happen if not done right.  Will say good-by as I am on my way downtown.  Love - Mother |

[^1]: "The neighbors" who smoked the Lavery family out were a recently-widowed Mrs. Comeau and her two young daughters.  The youngest was admitted to the hospital a day or so before this letter, but released the next morning.  Smoke inhalation, perhaps?
