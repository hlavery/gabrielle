Do not need any Vitamins will be glad when warm weather is here.  Every time I go out I catch more cold.  John was awfully lonesome over (illegible) going to the draft.  He did not say so but I could tell by the way he acted.  Guess Aunty is well have not seen her for three or four days.  By the way Mary Finn's[^2] engagement was in the paper this morning.  Be good. </p><p> Love, Mother |
