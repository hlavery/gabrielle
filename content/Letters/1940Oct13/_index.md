I have to sit on the draft board that day.</p><p>  Did you hear Wilkie[^1] when he spoke in Harvard Square and how do you like him?</p><p>  Julia and I are listening to the old story Charlie McCarthy.  John is going to a dinner tomorrow at Fitzgeralds[^2].  They will never make John a politician.</p><p> |
