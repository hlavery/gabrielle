| ![](img210.jpg?height=700px) | ...registering Wednesday?  I have to sit on the draft board that day.  Did you hear Wilkie when he spoke in Harvard Square and how do you like him?  Julia and I are listening to the old story Charlie McCarthy.  John is going to a dinner tomorrow at FitzGeralds.  They will never make John a politician. |
| ![](img211.jpg?height=700px) | One thing I will say it is too bad John did not take a hole(?) when you were home and make it a little easier for you.  He is grand I miss judge him greatly.  He and Phil get on fine.  Phil worked last night and said his co worker Nolan skipped and came up here to the Midnight Review for three hours.  I told him to never do that. | 
| ![](img212.jpg?height=700px) | I am having a busy week with the draft and registration.  Hope you are eating enougn also having some fun *(at MIT??...ed)*.  Please write a nice long letter and tell us all about yourself.  By the way, ???? is the idea (some fun) Ha-Ha.  Is that what I sent my son to (college) for Love Mother PS Do you need anything?   |
