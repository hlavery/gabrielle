| ![](img206.jpg?height=700px) | <p> Dear Hugh, Just a note to say I lived through the draft *(Gabrielle was on the local draft board...ed)*.  It was bad on my eyes. You had to print the card and I do not shine at that.  John spelled me at night.</p><p> Thomas LaHaise *(1913-1970, died in an auto accident)* was married yesterday *(to Alice Moody (1915-1982) m. 1940)*.  He looked very happy at the polls. I did not see them married.</p><p>  Phil is doing the early trick *("early trick" is probably the 11-7 night shift at the papermill...ed)* |
| ![](img207.jpg?height=700px) | this week.  He likes it the best of all also He is Aunt Jules *(Julia Haley McCann, Gabrielle's maternal aunt ... ed)* right hand man.  Aunty is pretty well and glad to hear from you.</p><p> Mr. D *(Foster Doane, Dad's mentor in terms of going to college...ed.)* told John *(brother, who also worked for Mr. Doane in the papermill...ed)* he had a letter from you so I guess everything is all right.</p><p> I hope you like your new room also your roommate.  It is more pleasant having someone with you.</p><p> |
| ![](img208.jpg?height=700px) | John and Phil *(Dad's brothers...ed)*  are quite the pals never did I expect to see the day, some things I have to laugh at.</p><p> Well dear will say good-by be a good boy and God bless you.</p><p>  MOTHER  GABRIELLE LAVERY
