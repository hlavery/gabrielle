Gabrielle Heffron died suddenly at her home on April 6, 1941.  Her obituary ran in the local paper on April 10.  
<p> I have never seen her cause of death listed anywhere.  Her death must have been unanticipated, After all, she had been out to the movies on March 28, and done some banking errands on the same day.  She had, however, been vaguely ill for years.</p>
