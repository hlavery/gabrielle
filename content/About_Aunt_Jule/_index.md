The formidable matriarch of the Lavery family in the 1930s until her death in 1943 was Julia Haley McCann, often mentioned as "Aunt Jule" or "Aunt Julia".  The epithet her neice Gabrielle Heffron, applies at one point is "caustic" as edited from ~~sarcastic~~.

Julia (1865-1943) was the last surviving daughter of the twelve children of James Haley (1819-1906) and Mary Faracy (1821-1894).  She had married Arthur McCann in 1891.  Dr. McCann was a prosperous dentist in Warrensburg, NY.  They had one son, Arthur McCann Jr (1895-1913), who tragically died of "scarlet fever and sepsis" at age 18 while a student at Fordham University in the Bronx, NY. He was presumably a pre-med student.

After the death of her husband, Arthur McCann (1861-1919) at the age of 58, Julia was left very well-off, with a large house on Grove Avenue, Glens Falls, NY.

Gabrielle Haley seems to have been a favorite niece. Gabrielle's sons became favorite grand-nephews, gave the matriarch much attention and help, and were well rewarded in her will.

Gabrielle also got a ride in the car, with an unidentified friend.  The background may be the old Glens Falls fairgrounds
